# AAE — Aesthetic Art Ekt

**Created by Milan Tegeltija, May 2025**

## What is AAE?

AAE (Aesthetic Art Ekt) is a proposed tagging and classification standard for visual media that captures the nuanced space between traditional art, sensual aesthetics, and respectful, non-explicit representation. It is not NSFW — it is NIFS: Non-Invasive, Fully Stylized.

## Core Principles

- **Artistic Intent** — Not for shock, but for emotional resonance.
- **Respectful Composition** — Strong, aesthetic, human subjects.
- **Emotional Layer** — Often cinematic, reflective, or narrative in tone.

## Sample Code Use

```json
{
  "tag": "AAE-WTRWND-MSCN-VLU84",
  "description": "A woman with wet hair stands by the window, lit by city lights, wearing a translucent white shirt. Moody, cinematic, contemplative.",
  "attributes": {
    "style": "cinematic",
    "mood": "moody",
    "lighting": "low-key warm",
    "subject": "female athletic",
    "nsfw": false
  }
}
```
